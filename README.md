# CSS Container

This utility takes a css file (input) and prefixes (contains) the css rules with a selector

## Why
I was trying to contain the Tailwind CSS library within a container. I couldn't see a easy way to prepend every css rule with my `#app` selector. So I decided to write this small utility to get the job done.
